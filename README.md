# Simple Web Application using Grails
Grails is a framework built on top of the SpringBoot project and uses the Apache Groovy language to develop web applications.
It is inspired by the Rails Framework for Ruby and is built around the convention-over-configuration philosophy which allows reducing boilerplate code

# Writing Unit and Integration tests
Grails mainly takes advantage of Spock for testing purposes. Integration tests can be done for the service layer and I test integration with a database configured. For this project I use the in-memory database by Grails.
